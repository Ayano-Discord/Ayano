# Ayano
A multipurpose discord bot that is being written in rust (for now).

## Important!
This bot is still being rewritten, and could be cancelled at any moment. There are 2 version for this bot currently, the C# and the Rust one being written, both are available on their respective branches, V1/Csharp and V1/Rust.

## Contributing
If you wish to contribute to the beta version, please contribute to the Rust branch (Available at V1/Rust, but if you are most comfortable in C#, then do write in c#.If you do decide to write in C#, then your code will be tried to be ported over to Rust by me or some other contributor.

We encourage making a pull request before you start writing code instead of after you're done!
